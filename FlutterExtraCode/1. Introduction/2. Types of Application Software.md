![Types of Application](https://github.com/walkingtree/images/blob/master/flutter/types_of_application.png)

Based on platform, applications can broadly be classified as:

* **Desktop Applications** - These applications are downloaded on a desktop/laptop and are limited by the Operating System and hardware for which they are developed. For example, .Net framework, C#, Visual Basic and few others languages are used to develop a desktop application for Windows OS while Cocoa software, Python, Ruby and few others languages are used to develop a desktop application for MacOS. Example applications are MS Office, Photoshop, AutoCAD, Outlook, etc. 

* **Web Applications** - These applications are accessed through the device's web browser and don't need to be downloaded. These applications relieve the developer of the responsibility of building an app for a specific type of computer or a specific operating system, so anyone can use the application as long as they have the internet access.These applications are built using the web technologies HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Example applications are Gmail, G Suite, Online banking app, etc.

* **Mobile Applications** - These applications are maily of three types: 
  * _Hybrid Applications_ - These apps, like web apps, are built with Javascript, HTML, and CSS but, using technologies like Cordove or Ionic and others, can be packaged for different platforms and can also access the device features like camera, location, etc. Hence, with one codebase, a developer can make these applications run on a Windows phone or Apple phone or Android phone. Example applications are Marketwatch, Sworkit, Untappd, Tripline, etc.
  
  * _Native Applications_ - These applications are built in a specific programming language, for a specific device platform, either iOS or Android. Native iOS apps are written in Swift or Objective-C and native Android apps are written in Java or Kotlin. Apple and Google also provide their own development tools (Xcode, Android Studio) and standardised SDK to developers. These apps are not cross-platform but surely give a nice user experience because their UI/UX match the platform conventions. Example applications are Pokemon Go, Twitter, and Waze.
  
  * _Cross-Platform Native Applications_ - The main disadvantage of native apps is having to develop apps separately for each platform you want to cover. Alternatively, cross-platform native apps can be developed, without sacrificing the user experience or access to native APIs. 
    
    Each operating system has its own SDK and major technology (Java for Android and Objective-C/Swift for iOS app development). But, there are several frameworks like Xamarin, React Native, Flutter, etc., that can create a cross-platform app, utilizing the native SDK, giving the best user experience. Example applications are Pinterest, Facebook, Walmart, Tesla, Airbnb, Google Ads, Alibaba, etc.
