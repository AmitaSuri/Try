**Frontend**: The part of an application that the user sees and interacts with, is termed as frontend or the 'client side' of the application. It includes everything that the user experiences directly: text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, colors, navigation menu, etc. The structure, design, behavior and content of frontend is implemented by frontend developers. 

**Backend**: Backend is server side of the application, the part that the user cannot see and interact with. It stores and arranges data, and also makes sure everything on the client-side of the application works fine. The parts and characteristics developed by backend designers are indirectly accessed by users through a front-end application.
