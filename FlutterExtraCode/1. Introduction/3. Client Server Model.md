A client-server network is designed for end-users, called clients, to access resources such as files, songs, video collections, or some other service from a central computer called a server. 

In the context of world wide web, 

* Browser is the client who sends request to the server for some data or information
* Remote Web Server receives the request. It has code that processes the request and sends response to the client
* Client uses this information
